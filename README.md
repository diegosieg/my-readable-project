# Readable Project

This is a fork from the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).
The project is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## TL;DR

To get started, please:

* clone this repository

* Install and start the API server

  * `cd api-server`
  * `npm install`
  * `node server`

* go to the `frontend folder` and install all project dependencies with `npm install`
  * `cd frontend`
  * `npm install`
* so, start the project with `npm start`

  * `npm start`

* enjoy it ;)
